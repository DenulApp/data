Raw data
========

This directory contains raw, unaggregated data from the simulator. The files have the following naming pattern:
- `simulation-rounds-u[number of initial users]-s[number of simulation rounds].csv` contains the intermediate results from all simulation rounds of all runs
- `user-distribution-u[number of initial users]-s[number of simulation rounds].csv` contains the user degree distribution results from all simulation rounds of all runs

These files are rather large. Keep that in mind when opening them.
